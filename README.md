This repository is a python script on streaming to stream.live

You will need to install ffmpy for python.  
You can do this by typing in: pip install ffmpy

This python script works on both python 2.7 and python 3.6

If you are using Windows 10 you need to link your python as an enviormental variable.  Otherwise you can goto C:/python27/Scripts/ to use pip to install packages.

On Linux/Mac you should be able to just type in pip install ffmpy in the command terminal.


NOTICE

On Line 9 of the code you need to type in your own RTMP key.  Otherwise the code will crash since there isn't a valid rtmp key currenly residing on that line.
